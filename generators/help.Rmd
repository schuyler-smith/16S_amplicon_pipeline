```{css echo=FALSE}
code{
  white-space: pre !important;
  overflow-x: scroll !important;
  word-break: keep-all !important;
  word-wrap: initial !important;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

The only parameters that should be necessary to change are in the top section with 

```{bash eval=FALSE} 
DIRECTORY=/mnt/research/germs/Schuyler/Projects/X
RAWDAT_DIRECTORY=$DIRECTORY/original
MAPPING_FILE=$RAWDAT_DIRECTORY/map.txt
CORES=20

OVERLAP=10
MINLENGTH=210 
MAXLENGTH=280
Q=10
CLUSTER=0.99
```

Feel free to explore other parameters within the code. As long as you have the raw data backed-up, there is no commands in this pipeline that should be able to make unfixable mistakes.
