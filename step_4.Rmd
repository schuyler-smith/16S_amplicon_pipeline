## Clustering

Read clustering has become a hot-topic in this type of pipeline recently. Historically, reads have been clustered to 97% similiarity. The reasons for this were partly biological and mostly computational. The file size difference between clustering to 97% and 99% is significant. Some advocate not clustering at all. I'm going to recommend 99% clustering.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
mkdir -p $DIR/cdhit_clustering/master_otus/../R/../combined_seqs
cd-hit-est -i $DIR/cdhit_clustering/combined_seqs/all_sequences.fa -o $DIR/cdhit_clustering/combined_seqs/combined_seqs_cdhit.fasta -c 0.95 -M 200000 -T 20
```
