This is a repository with various versions of the 16S amplicon processing pipeline that I have used created by <a href="https://github.com/fandemonium" target="_blank">Fan Yang</a> in the  <a href="http://germslab.org/" target="_blank">GERMS-lab</a>. She periodically updates <a href="https://github.com/germs-lab/amplicon_pipelines" target="_blank">her pipeline</a> but I will do so here, with my own preferences to it, as well as keep it presented in the hosted site version in the link above.
